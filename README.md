# TypeScript NodeJS Boilerplate

To use this boilerplate, either clone it using `git clone`, download it as ZIP or use [GitHub Repository Import](https://github.com/new/import).

The following are configured:

- TypeScript
- Yarn
- Jest
- GitHub Actions CI

And the following scripts:

- `build` - compiles source code into JS, outputs to `dist`
- `test` - runs tests using Jest
- `start` - compiles the server, then uses `node` to run it from the compiled files
- `dev` - runs the server in dev mode, and automatically refreshes
